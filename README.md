# RecurPost
RecurPost allows you to share your best updates on social platforms in a recurring manner.RecurPost is a simple way to build your business on social media. RecurPost lets you post on all social media platforms in one place.  Unlike other social media schedulers where you need to schedule your content every time you want it to go out, you can now recycle your previous content based on a set schedule. For instance, you can set your blogposts to go out once a day. Once an update has gone out it waits in your blogs library only to be posted once everything has been posted.
